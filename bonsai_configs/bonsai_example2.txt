# This is a bonsai config file for "example 2" in ch_frb_l1/MANUAL.md.
#
# This toy config uses three dedispersion trees with different levels
# of upsampling/downsampling , to search data with 1024 frequency channels
# to max DM 412.
#
# For more information on bonsai, including documentation of the configuration
# file and pointers to example programs, a good place to start is MANUAL.md
# in the bonsai repository (https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/bonsai/blob/master/MANUAL.md).

# These parameters are used in bonsai's mask-filling and variance estimation logic.
