# This is a 1024-channel bonsai paramfile, assuming 512 FPGA counts/sample.
#
# Since it assumes 1024 frequency channels (rather than 16K) the
# computational cost is much lower than what we expect on the real
# L1 node.
#
# The search uses three 4K-trees:
#   - one upsampled (nups=2, max DM 138)
#   - one at native resolution (max DM 276)
#   - one downsampled (nups=2, max DM 552)


# For no deep reason, the (variance, reweighting) timescales are currently (100, 100) in
# the 1K-channel bonsai configs, and (200, 400) in the 16K-channel configs.  These values
# are chosen semi-arbitrarily, and we should do a study to determine optimal settings!
