# This is a bonsai config file for a "production-scale" real-time
# search with 16384 frequency channels, searched to max DM 13000.
# It uses 7-8 GB memory/beam, so it will not run on a laptop.
#
# Important note #1: "Production" bonsai_configs (i.e. filenames beginning with "bonsai_production_...")
# are intended to be "set in stone" after they are committed to git.  If you want to change parameters 
# in a production config file, make a new copy of the file and increment the version number!
#
# Important note #2: The production bonsai_configs are kept in three places:
#
#    - in the ch_frb_l1 repository
#    - in the ch_frb_rfi repository
#    - in `/data/bonsai_configs` on the CHIME nodes (frb1, frb-compute-0, etc.)  
#
# It is important to make sure that the three versions don't get out of sync!  This should
# happen automatically if production configs are never changed after committing them to git.
#
# Reminder: currently, bonsai config files must be constructed by a two-step process as follows.
# First, a human-editable text file `bonsai_xxx.txt` is written.  Second, this is "compiled"
# into an HDF5 file using the utility `bonsai-mkweight`.
#
# Note that we don't put the HDF5 files in git, since they are large files, so you may need
# to create the hdf5 files by hand using the above procedure.  Exception: on the CHIME nodes, 
# the "production" HDF5 files should already be in /data/bonsai_configs.
#
# The production-scale bonsai configs differ in number of trial
# spectral indices, and whether an upsampled tree is used to improve
# signal-to-noise for narrow pulses (<~ 1 ms) at DM <= 820.
#
# params_noups_nbeta1.txt: no upsampled tree, 1 trial spectral index.
# params_noups_nbeta2.txt: no upsampled tree, 2 trial spectral indices.  (*)
# params_ups_nbeta1.txt:   upsampled tree, 1 trial spectral index.       (*)
# params_ups_nbeta2.txt:   upsampled tree, 2 trial spectral indices.     (*)
#
# (*) Important note #3: currently, RFI removal is running slower than originally hoped (0.55 cores/beam).
#     This means that only the first production config (params_noups_nbeta1.txt) will actually work!
#     Otherwise, the L1 server will run too slow, and eventually crash!
#
# As mentioned in ch_frb_l1 MANUAL.md, there is currently a technical
# issue in the bonsai code which requires an artificially large bonsai
# chunk size (8 seconds).  This technical issue also means that if you
# modify the bonsai config file, there's a good chance you'll get
# cryptic errors like:
#
#  bonsai_ups_nbeta2.txt: nt_tree[3]=256 is too small (minimum value for this config = 320)
#
# Just let me know if you need help.  This technical issue will be fixed soon!
#
# For more information on bonsai, including documentation of the configuration
# file and pointers to example programs, a good place to start is MANUAL.md
# in the bonsai repository (https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/bonsai/blob/master/MANUAL.md).
