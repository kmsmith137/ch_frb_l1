# This is a bonsai config file for "example 1" in ch_frb_l1/MANUAL.md.

# This toy config uses a single dedispersion tree, to search data
# with 1024 frequency channels to max DM 207.
#
# For more information on bonsai, including documentation of the configuration
# file and pointers to example programs, a good place to start is MANUAL.md
# in the bonsai repository (https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/bonsai/blob/master/MANUAL.md).
