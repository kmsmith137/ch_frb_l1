# This example assumes the nodes are in a non-link-bonded configuration, where
# each of the four 1 Gbps NIC's is on an independent /24 network.  We use UDP
# port 6677 on all four NIC's.  Traffic is divided between NIC's "per beam", 
# i.e. four beams will be sent to each NIC.

ipaddr: "127.0.0.1"
port: [7000, 7001, 7002, 7003, 7004, 7005, 7006, 7007 ]

# Total number of threads used by the L0 simulator.
# Note: nthreads must be a multiple of the number of "streams", which
# is the number of distinct (ipaddr,port) pairs (in this case nsteams=2).
