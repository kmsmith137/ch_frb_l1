# This is a toy L1b script, intended as a way of documenting the L1a-L1b interface.
# For example usage, see "Quick-start examples which can run on a laptop" in MANUAL.md.
#
# This script receives coarse-grained triggers from L1a, and "processes" them by generating
# a big waterfall plot (toy_l1b_beam${BEAM_ID}.png).
#
# Although toy-l1b.py is intended as documentation, it may also be useful for debugging,
# since it provides a simple way of plotting the output of L1a.
#
# The bonsai.PipedDedisperser class is used to receive data from L1a.  For another
# toy example illustrating use of this class (outside the L1 server framework), see 
# examples_python/example4*.py in the bonsai repository.

# When the L1 server spawns its L1b subprocesses, it uses the command line:
#
#   <l1b_executable_filename> <l1b_config_filename> <beam_id>
#
# The l1b_config_filename is specified on the command line when the L1 server
# is started.  It is "opaque" to the L1 server, and just gets passed along via
# the L1b command line.  Since this toy L1b script doesn't need any config
# information, we just ignore it here.

# 'stdin' for the child process) which will be used to send coarse-grained triggers, and
# bonsai config_params.  The bonsai.PipedDedisperser python class will read and decode data
# sent over the pipe.  For more information see the bonsai.PipedDedisperser docstring, or

# the first chunk, and 'fpga_counts_per_sample', the number of fpga counts per time
# sample (currently 384).
#
# Note that this code blocks until the pipeline starts receiving data, so it's best
# to put it after any slow initializations.
#
# (Just to explain what is going on in the code: the bonsai.PipedDedisperser contains a
#  "context" string which is opaque to bonsai.  In the CHIME pipeline, this string is
#  constructed by serializing a json object containing pipeline "attributes"
#  defined in rf_pipelines.  Currently there are only two pipeline attributes,
#  initial_fpga_count and fpga_counts_per_sample, but I plan to put the beam_id
#  here soon, and remove it from the L1B command line.)
