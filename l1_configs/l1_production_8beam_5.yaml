# This is an 8-beam example.  We use real RFI removal (provisional), and dedispersion 
# with the most optimal settings (spectral index search, low-DM upsampled tree).
#
# In this example, we still use a "toy" version of the L1B code which just prints messages
# as it receives coarse-grained triggers.  (It it also supposed to make a trigger plot, but 
# this doesn't work in production yet, since the production L1 server has no way of shutting

# This example assumes the nodes are in a non-link-bonded configuration, where
# each of the four 1 Gbps NIC's is on an independent /24 network.  We use UDP
# port 1313 on all four NIC's.  Traffic is divided between NIC's "per beam", 
# i.e. four beams will be sent to each NIC.  All NIC's use TCP port 5555 for
# their RPC server.

# The L1 node is configured so that it "thinks" the NFS server is four different
# servers, mounted on directories /frb-archiver1, /frb-archiver2, /frb-archiver3,
# /frb-archiver4.  File writes to each of these four filesystems will be sent from
# the corresponding NIC.  The node is responsible for load-balancing file writes 
# between these filesystems.
#
# Here, we define 5 output_devices, corresponding to (4 NIC's) + (1 SSD).
# Each output device will get a separate file I/O thread.  This allows file
# I/O on each device to proceed independently.
#
# Note that the way things are currently implemented, in the 8-beam case, we only e
# end up using 2 out of 4 NIC's to write to NFS.  (I'm not sure if this is good or bad.)

# of the L1b code which "processes" coarse-grained triggers by
# making a big waterfall plot (toy_l1b_beam*.png).
#
# For a production-scale example, it makes sense to set l1b_pipe_timeout=0,
# and set l1b_buffer_nsamples based on the maximum acceptable latency between
# L1a and L1b (in this case we use 4000, corresponding to 4 seconds).  See
# MANUAL.md for discussion!

# If "streaming" is enabled, the node will continuously stream all incoming data
# to either its local SSD or NFS.
#
# 'stream_devname': Either "ssd" (the default) or "nfs".
#
#     NFS bandwidth is limited, so if you're writing to NFS then you probably want to reduce the
#     number of beam_ids, by assigning a value to 'stream_beam_ids'.
#
# 'stream_acqname': Unique identifying directory names for the acqisition
#
#     If the given acquisition already exists (probably from a previous run)
#     the L1 server will abort.
#
# 'stream_beam_ids': A list of beam_ids to stream to disk.
#
#     Must be a subset of 'beam_ids', the set of all beam_ids processed by the server.
#     If unspecified, every beam_id processed by the server will be streamed.
#
# Example 1: to stream all beams to SSD, just do
#   stream_acqname: ACQNAME
#
# Example 2: to stream beam 0 to NFS, do
#   stream_devname: "nfs"
#   stream_acqname: ACQNAME
