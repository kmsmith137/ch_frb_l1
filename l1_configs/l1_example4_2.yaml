# This is "example 4" to run on the 8-node system, described in MANUAL.md.

# This is a production-scale example which will monopolize 4 x 20-core
# nodes cf0g[0-3] acting as receivers and cf0g[4-7] acting as senders.
# The L1 server will dedisperse 16 beams, with 16384 frequency
# channels.
#
# nt_per_packet=16 is important here, since the 'fast' kernels are hardcoded to
# use nt_per_packet=16.  See MANUAL.md for more dicussion!

# This example assumes the nodes are in a non-link-bonded configuration, where
# each of the four 1 Gbps NIC's is on an independent /24 network.  We use UDP
# port 6677 on all four NIC's.  Traffic is divided between NIC's "per beam", 
# i.e. four beams will be sent to each NIC.  All NIC's use TCP port 5555 for
# their RPC server.

# The L1 node is configured so that it "thinks" the NFS server is four different
# servers, mounted on directories /frb-archiver1, /frb-archiver2, /frb-archiver3,
# /frb-archiver4.  File writes to each of these four filesystems will be sent from
# the corresponding NIC.  The node is responsible for load-balancing file writes 
# between these filesystems.
#
# Here, we define 5 output_devices, corresponding to (4 NIC's) + (1 SSD).
# Each output device will get a separate file I/O thread.  This allows file
# I/O on each device to proceed independently.

# For a production-scale example, it makes sense to set l1b_pipe_timeout=0,
# and set l1b_buffer_nsamples based on the maximum acceptable latency between
# L1a and L1b (in this case we use 4000, corresponding to 4 seconds).  See
# MANUAL.md for discussion!
