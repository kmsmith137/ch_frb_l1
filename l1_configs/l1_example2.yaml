# This toy L1 server instance expects 4 beams, with 1024 frequencies.
#
# In subscale test programs, the value of 'nt_per_packet' isn't very important, but
# should be the same on the L0 simulator and the L1 server.  (For discussion, see
# "Config file reference: L1 server" in MANUAL.md.)

# Configure the L1 server to expect 4 beams, on the loopback 
# interface (127.0.0.1).  Just for fun, we split the input data
# between UDP ports 6677 and 6678.  (Beam IDs 0+1 will be sent
# to port 6677, and beam IDs 2+3 will be sent to port 6678.)
#
# There is one RPC server for each stream, and each RPC server
# must have a different address.  In this example there are two
# streams (since there are two distinct (ip_addr, udp_port) pairs),
# so 'rpc_address' must be a length-2 list.  To make the addresses
# different, we run one RPC server on port 5555, and one on port 5556.
